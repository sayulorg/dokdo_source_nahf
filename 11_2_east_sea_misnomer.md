2. East Sea Misnomer “East Sea” is a name that Koreans have been using for more than 2,000 years. This fact can be verified in the following historical archives and maps: “Epitaph of King Gwanggaeto” (414) in Samguk Saki[三国史記, The History of Three Kingdoms], “Map of the Eight Provinces” in New and Expanded Complete Conspectus of the Territory of the Eastern Country, and “Complete Map of Joseon” from “Map of the Territory” (late eighteenth century). Until the end of the nineteenth century, Japanese maps labeled the East Sea as “Sea of Joseon” or “Sea of Japan.” In Western maps, a variety of names were used, including Sea of China, Manchuria Sea, Eastern Sea, East Sea, Sea of Korea, Sea of Japan, and Tartar Sea. However, as of the late nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth century, “Sea of Japan” was generally accepted among the international community as Japan’s international influence had grown. After joining the United Nations in 1991, the Korean government claimed during the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) in 1992 that the sole naming of the East Sea as the “Sea of Japan” was unreasonable. The international community has advised that when a naming dispute arises between two countries both names are to be used until an agreement is reached. Korea has stated that both “East Sea” and “Sea of Japan” be used, but Japan has taken the position that any name other than “Sea of Japan” for the area is unacceptable.
