8) Dokdo’s Restoration after World War II Dokdo was relegated to the control of the United States military from August 15, 1945, until the formal establishment of the Republic of Korea on August 15, 1948, when it was transferred back to the Korean government. As World War II was drawing to an end, leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China held a conference in Cairo, Egypt, from November 22–26, 1943. The Cairo Declaration signed by the Allies explicitly stated, “Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed.” A direct reference to Korea stated, “The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.” The Cairo Declaration is cited in Clause 8 of the Potsdam Declaration (July 26, 1945), which stated, "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.” On August 15, 1945, the Empire of Japan accepted the provisions outlined by the Potsdam Declaration and declared unconditional surrender. The Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on September 2, 1945. Upon the implementation of the United States Military Government in Japan on January 29, 1946, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) issued SCAPIN Order No. 677 with provisions for the “Governmental and Administrative Separation of Certain Outlying Areas from Japan.” The contents of the declaration defined the scope of Japanese domain to be the four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku) and approximately 1,000 smaller adjacent islands. Furthermore, Clause 3 expressly excluded Ulleungdo, Dokdo, and Jejudo from Japanese territory. The map attached to this directive specifically labeled Ulleungdo and Dokdo as Korean territory. On June 22, 1946, SCAPIN Order No. 1033 was issued, and provisions under Clause 3 explicitly stated, “Japanese vessels will not approach closer than twelve (12) miles” to Dokdo. The Government of the Republic of Korea was established on August 15, 1948, on the basis of a United Nations resolution, and Dokdo’s Korean sovereignty was restored to its current status.
