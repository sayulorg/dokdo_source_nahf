3) The State of Usan’s Tribute to Silla and Goryeo According to Samguk Saki [三国史記, The History of Three Kingdoms], General Kim Isabu of Silla conquered and annexed the State of Usan (Ulleungdo and Dokdo) in 512. As a result, Usan paid tribute to Silla and Goryeo. History of Goryeo recorded that in 930 Usan dispatched Baek Gil and To Du to pay tribute. When Usan’s agriculture was devastated following an invasion by the northeastern Jurchens in 1018, the Goryeo government supported Usan with farming equipment and seeds. For the purpose of relocating mainland citizens to Ulleungdo, King Uijong dispatched Myeongjudo’s tax administrator Kim Yu-rip in 1157 to verify whether the island was suitable for residence.
