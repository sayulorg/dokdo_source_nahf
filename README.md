Dokdo Source (NAHF)
Archival Markdown Conversion of Dokdo Historical Materials from NAHF

This repository stores a fully structured, Markdown-based version of the official Dokdo historical materials published by the Northeast Asian History Foundation (NAHF).
The purpose of this project is to preserve the original content, increase accessibility, and enable global researchers, educators, and AI models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) to easily retrieve and analyze the historical materials.

**16 Markdown files**

The original NAHF text has been divided exactly by chapter, without modification.
This allows clean ingestion into LLM systems and supports section-based referencing.
Ⅰ. Dokdo in History – 8 files
Ⅱ. Dokdo Controversies – 1 file
Ⅲ. Dokdo Educational Resources – 7 files
Total: 16 files


**Purpose of This Repository**
1. Preservation & Accessibility
The original content is provided in a lightweight, portable Markdown format to ensure long-term accessibility.
2. Research & Education
The files can be used for:
Academic reference
Curriculum development
Policy and diplomatic research
Fact-checking and media work
3. AI Model Compatibility
All Markdown files are optimized for:
GPT / Gemini / Claude / Llama document ingestion
Vector indexing
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
Dataset creation for training/finetuning
This ensures that AI systems can correctly recognize the structure and meaning of the historical text.
