6) Ulleungdo Development and the “Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire” Although the retrieval policy was still in effect in the late Joseon period, transit to Ulleungdo was frequent, and Japanese fishermen continued to harvest abalone and perform logging operations there. In the wake of the Treaty of Ganghwado in 1876, Japanese intrusion into Ulleungdo went unhindered. In 1882, Joseon instituted the Ulleungdo Development Policy and began actively relocating people to Ulleungdo. As the number of Ulleungdo residents and Japanese immigrants increased, a stronger administration was required to manage the residents. After Japan secured victory in the Sino-Japanese War, a surge of Japanese immigrants to Ulleungdo proved burdensome. The Great Han Empire government dispatched Inspector Woo Yong-jeong to Ulleungdo in June, 1900. After his investigation, Woo Yong-jeong filed a detailed report and proposed to deport Japanese immigrants, purchase a ship, and overhaul the island’s administration. In response, the government issued Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire in October 1900 and reaffirmed Ulleungdo and Dokdo’s sovereignty by modernizing their administration. Ulleungdo was renamed Uldo and the area was brought into the Uldo County jurisdiction and Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo provisions were created. In the ordinance, “Seokdo” refers to Dokdo. Imperial Ordinance No. 41 was published in the Official Gazette on October 27, 1900, and Ulleungdo and Dokdo’s sovereignty was claimed in accordance with modern law. Dokdo in the East Sea Ⅰ.
