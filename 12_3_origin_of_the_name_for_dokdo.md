3. Origin of the Name for Dokdo Ulleungdo and Dokdo have been Korean territory since the Three Kingdoms Period, when General Kim Isabu of Silla conquered the State of Usan in 512. In the past, Dokdo has been primarily called Usando, Sambongdo, Jasando, and Gajido in Korea. The name Dokdo emerged sometime in the twentieth century. In 1883, major development began on Ulleungdo, and many people from Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces relocated to the island. The new residents of Ulleungdo began to call the rock islands to the east “Dokseom” in their regional dialect. “Seok” (石) and “dok” (獨) were used to express the Korean word in written Chinese. “Seok” (石) refers to “rock/stone” and was used because it has the same meaning in Chinese. “Dok” (獨) was used because it has the same sound as the Korean word for “rock/stone” in Chinese. Declared in 1900, the “Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire” refers to Dokdo as “Seokdo.” The maritime logbook for the Japanese warship Niitaka recorded on September 9, 1904, that “Koreans call it ‘Dokdo’” during the exploratory voyage to Dokdo for installing a watchtower for the purposes of monitoring the Russian fleet. This entry in the logbook was the first time the term “Dokdo” appeared in official records, but the Imperial Ordinance suggests that the term had already been in general use.
