7) Dokdo’s Annexation, the First Signal of the Invasion of Korea During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Japan realized the strategic value of Ulleungdo and Dokdo and sought to annex the islands. As a result of pressure from Japanese Navy officials, Nakai Yōzaburō, a Shimane Prefecture fisherman who had his own ambitions for a seal-hunting monopoly near Dokdo, submitted his “Request for Territorial Incorporation of Liancodo” to Japan’s Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce on September 29, 1904. At this time, Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed interest in erecting a watchtower on Dokdo and installing radio facilities or submarine communications cables. In accordance with this petition, the Japanese government cabinet agreed to the incorporation of “terra nullius” (land belonging to no one) on January 28, 1905. About one month later, on February 22, the Shimane Prefecture Notice No. 40 was issued. The decision to annex Dokdo was made unilaterally without any prior inquiry or notice having been given to the Great Han Empire. The Great Han Empire was unaware of Dokdo’s annexation for more than one year after the fact when Uldo County Magistrate Sim Heung-taek was notified on March 28, 1906. When the Deputy Prime Minister Park Je-sun became aware of this fact, he issued Order No. 3 on May 20, 1906. This order stated, “There is no basis for Japan’s claim of Dokdo. Reinvestigate Dokdo’s situation and the activities of the Japanese and report back.” The Korean Daily Report (May 1, 1906) and the Capital Gazette (May 9, 1906) also published articles in protest. However, the Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty had already been signed in November 1905, and Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was abolished in January 1906. By February, the Japanese Resident-General of Korea had been established, and the country was under Japan’s complete control. These events effectively removed any possibility of protest to the Japanese government with regard to Dokdo’s annexation. Despite these circumstances, Japan continues to justify the annexation of Dokdo by claiming that the Great Han Empire government never actively protested against the islet’s annexation.
