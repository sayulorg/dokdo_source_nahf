5. Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire and Dokdo’s Sovereignty under Modern Law The Great Han Empire succeeded the Joseon government in 1897. After the Joseon government instituted an Ulleungdo development policy, the number of Ulleungdo residents and Japanese immigrants increased, and stronger administration was required to govern the residents. After Japan secured victory in the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, a surge of Japanese immigrants to Ulleungdo proved burdensome. The Great Han Empire government, with assistance from the Japanese government, dispatched a joint inspection committee to investigate the situation in Ulleungdo (May 31–June 5, 1900). Dispatched to Ulleungdo by the Great Han Empire government, Inspector Woo Yong-jeong proposed to deport Japanese immigrants, purchase a ship, and reform the island’s administration. As a result, the government issued Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire (October 25, 1900) to raise the position of mayor to governor and change the island’s name from Ulleungdo to Uldo (Official Gazette, No. 1716, October 27, 1900). In addition, the area was brought under the jurisdiction of Uldo County, and Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo provisions were introduced. “Jukdo” referred to a small satellite island, and “Seokdo” to Dokdo. Korea had exercised sovereignty over Dokdo since the Three Kingdoms Period, and it was reaffirmed in accordance with modern law through Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Great Han Empire.
